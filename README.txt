Project 2 Readme
----------------
Stephen Roller

Attributions:
* Andrew Austin, Jerrod and I created our grammar together; I eventually 
  modified it slightly
* My code is 100% my own.
* In addition to creating some unit tests of my own, I took advantage of
  Robert Phillip's test suite on the forum.

Make sure ice9.py is executable (chmod +x ice9.py). Then redirection should
work as in the project specification

$ ./ice9 < file.9 > file.out 2>&1

To run the unit tests:

$ make test
